# MERN Boilerplate with MVC Architecture
This repository contains a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) boilerplate for building full-stack web applications following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. It includes separate directories for the backend and frontend components, allowing for modular development and easy deployment.
